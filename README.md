# Web Application for Web Development : TeamWeb8

## Problem Background
When searching for Indigenous data, you'll run into one of two issues: first, the data isn't available, and second, the data isn't accurate, even though if it's on Statistics Canada.  There have been some open source applications created by Indigenous peoples to help with this data gap, however these maps don't provide the user with much detail. Indigenous cultures have been erased from maps since the colonisation of Turtle Island, and they must be reintroduced into the mapping space to begin the healing process. There is no access to a web-based program that allows the Indigenous peoples of this country to feel like a sovereign group of people. A web application that maps Indigenous data will aid in learning the true history of these lands.

## Problem Statement
Ideal

A web app that maps indigenous languages and popluations across Ontario and provides general information about a subject that is under represented

### Reality

The data that is currently available is not properly represented visually when looking at Indigenous Languages spoken in Ontario.

### Consequences

Without mapping of Indigenous Languages, there will continue to be a misrepresentation of Indigenous people in Ontario.

### Proposal

We will use Esri Experience Builder to build an app that displays Indigenous Languages arcoss Ontario, data will be taken from Statisitics Canada to create the map and additional graphs/ information.

### Technology Used

ArcGIS Pro, Esri Experience Builder, ArcGIS Online Dashboards

### Expanding on this idea

We discovered tables and other data that we could use to create a visual map while on our quest to find correct language data. We gathered data on residential schools, various decades of first nations, and settlement population data during this process. We wanted to develop an accurate and open web map framework using this data in order to learn about this horrific past while also providing hope for the future.
